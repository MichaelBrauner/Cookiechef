# Build your own cookie consent with ease!

Every page within the EU needs a cookie banner these days. However, finding the right one can be difficult depending on the CMS system or framework.

It is not even primarily important to satisfy personal preferences - but to meet the legal requirements.

Because a cookie consent banner should meet the following requirements:

- It should be possible to confirm or reject each cookie individually.
- The decisions should be reversible or changed at any time.
- The cookies should only be set once they have been expressly confirmed.

That doesn't seem like much. However, there is little freeware that meets all of these requirements.

In addition, customers often have special requirements for the design of their cookie banners, which are difficult and cumbersome to implement by messing around with existing CSS.

However, if a customer has a request that requires structural changes to be made to the HTML of the cookie banner, this is simply impossible with finished cookie banner software.

This is why this little Javascript framework was written for cookies.
With this you can easily create your own cookie banner.
Without restrictions.
